# Audience Segmentation – Compliance-Safe Framework for Telemedicine

## Purpose of This Document

This document explains how a Telemedicine startup can segment and target audiences
**without violating healthcare advertising regulations** or platform policies
(Google Ads, Meta, HIPAA, NDPR).

The focus is on **intent, context, and behavior**, not medical conditions.

## Why Traditional Healthcare Targeting Fails

Most healthcare ad disapprovals come from:
- Condition-based targeting
- Sensitive health inferences
- Diagnosis-oriented messaging
- Fear-based urgency

This framework avoids all of the above.

- Life context
